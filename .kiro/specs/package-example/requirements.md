# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive package example that demonstrates the event-driven workflows functionality in the Go Templ Template application. The example should showcase user activation workflows, session cleanup workflows, and audit trail functionality in a working, executable format that developers can use to understand and test the system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working package example that demonstrates event-driven workflows, so that I can understand how the system works and test its functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package example is executed THEN the system SHALL successfully initialize all required components (database, event bus, services)
2. WHEN the package example runs THEN the system SHALL demonstrate user registration and activation workflows without compilation errors
3. WHEN the package example runs THEN the system SHALL demonstrate session cleanup workflows when user status changes
4. WHEN the package example runs THEN the system SHALL demonstrate audit trail functionality with queryable events

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package example to fix existing compilation issues, so that I can run the example without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package example is compiled THEN the system SHALL resolve all interface compatibility issues
2. WHEN the package example is compiled THEN the system SHALL provide correct arguments to all service constructors
3. WHEN the package example is compiled THEN the system SHALL use proper type conversions and implementations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package example to demonstrate real workflow scenarios, so that I can see how events flow through the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registration workflow is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL show user creation, deactivation, activation request, and activation completion
2. WHEN a session cleanup workflow is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL show user status changes triggering session cleanup
3. WHEN audit trail functionality is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL show event querying and filtering capabilities
4. WHEN workflows are demonstrated THEN the system SHALL show proper event sequencing and timing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package example to include proper error handling and logging, so that I can understand how to handle failures in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur during workflow execution THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN the package example runs THEN the system SHALL provide informative logging at each workflow step
3. WHEN the package example completes THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and connections
4. WHEN the package example encounters failures THEN the system SHALL continue with other demonstrations when possible

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package example to be easily configurable and runnable, so that I can adapt it to different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package example is configured THEN the system SHALL use environment-appropriate database and message broker settings
2. WHEN the package example is executed THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions and output for each demonstration
3. WHEN the package example is run THEN the system SHALL complete within a reasonable time frame
4. WHEN the package example finishes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all demonstrated workflows
