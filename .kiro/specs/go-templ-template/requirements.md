# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive template for Go fullstack applications using Templ as the frontend templating engine. The template will provide a solid foundation for developers to quickly bootstrap modern web applications with type-safe HTML templates, proper project structure, and essential features like authentication, database integration, and responsive UI components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete project template with Go backend and Templ frontend, so that I can quickly start building fullstack web applications without setting up boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer clones the template THEN the project SHALL include a complete Go module with proper structure
2. WHEN the developer runs the setup commands THEN the application SHALL start successfully with a working web interface
3. WHEN the developer accesses the application THEN it SHALL display a functional homepage with navigation
4. IF the developer follows the README instructions THEN they SHALL be able to run the application in development mode with hot reload

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want pre-built Templ components and layouts, so that I can build consistent and responsive web interfaces efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template is generated THEN it SHALL include base layout components (header, footer, navigation)
2. WHEN the template is generated THEN it SHALL include common UI components (buttons, forms, cards, modals)
3. WHEN components are rendered THEN they SHALL be responsive and work across different screen sizes
4. WHEN components are used THEN they SHALL follow consistent styling patterns with Tailwind CSS

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want basic authentication functionality, so that I can implement user management in my applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template includes auth THEN it SHALL provide login and registration pages
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate and create a session
3. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN they SHALL have access to protected routes
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN their session SHALL be terminated and they SHALL be redirected to login

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database integration with migrations, so that I can persist data and manage schema changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the template is set up THEN it SHALL include database connection configuration
2. WHEN migrations are run THEN they SHALL create necessary tables for users and sessions
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL connect to the database successfully
4. WHEN database operations are performed THEN they SHALL use proper error handling and transactions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a development environment with hot reload, so that I can see changes immediately during development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Air is configured THEN it SHALL watch for changes in Go files and restart the server
2. WHEN Templ files are modified THEN they SHALL be regenerated automatically
3. WHEN static files are changed THEN they SHALL be served without restart
4. WHEN the developer saves files THEN the browser SHALL reflect changes within 2 seconds

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and logging, so that I can debug issues and monitor application health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN HTTP errors happen THEN users SHALL see friendly error pages
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log startup information and configuration
4. WHEN requests are processed THEN they SHALL be logged with timing and status information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want containerization support, so that I can deploy the application consistently across environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker is used THEN the application SHALL build into a working container image
2. WHEN docker-compose is run THEN it SHALL start the application with database dependencies
3. WHEN the container runs THEN it SHALL serve the application on the specified port
4. WHEN environment variables are provided THEN the application SHALL use them for configuration
