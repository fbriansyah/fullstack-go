# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix interface compliance issues
  - Add missing GetUserSessions method to SimpleAuthService
  - Ensure all service implementations satisfy their interface contracts
  - Validate that all packages can build successfully
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Enhance database test utilities with timeout handling
  - Modify NewTestDatabase to include connection timeout configuration
  - Add SkipIfNoDatabase function with configurable timeout
  - Implement graceful test skipping when database is unavailable
  - Add environment variable support for test database timeout configuration
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 3. Create mock implementations for unit testing
  - Implement MockSessionRepository for testing without database dependencies
  - Create mock implementations of external services (EventBus, RateLimiter)
  - Add factory functions to create mock services for testing
  - Write unit tests using mock implementations to verify functionality
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 3.1, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Fix hanging database tests
  - Update UserRepository tests to use enhanced test utilities with timeouts
  - Implement proper test setup and teardown with connection management
  - Add test categorization to separate unit tests from integration tests
  - Ensure tests can run independently without external database when mocked
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Validate and fix build dependencies
  - Resolve any remaining build errors in shared packages
  - Ensure all imports are properly resolved
  - Validate that go build ./internal/... succeeds for all packages
  - Add build validation to prevent future interface compliance issues
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.3_
