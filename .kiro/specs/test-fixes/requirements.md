# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Go fullstack application has several test failures and build errors that need to be resolved to ensure code quality and maintainability. The main issues include database connection timeouts in tests, missing interface methods, and build failures in shared packages.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to pass successfully, so that I can confidently deploy and maintain the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `go test ./internal/...` THEN all tests SHALL pass without timeouts or failures
2. WHEN running tests THEN database-dependent tests SHALL use proper test database setup or mocking
3. WHEN tests require external dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly isolated or skipped when dependencies are unavailable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all packages to build successfully, so that the application can be compiled and deployed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `go build ./internal/...` THEN all packages SHALL compile without errors
2. WHEN interfaces are defined THEN all implementing types SHALL provide all required methods
3. WHEN dependencies exist between packages THEN they SHALL be properly resolved

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent test patterns across the codebase, so that tests are maintainable and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing database tests THEN they SHALL use consistent test utilities and setup patterns
2. WHEN tests require external services THEN they SHALL be properly mocked or use test containers
3. WHEN integration tests are written THEN they SHALL be clearly separated from unit tests
